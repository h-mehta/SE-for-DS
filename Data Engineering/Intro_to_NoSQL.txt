This document covers different types of NoSQL databases such as key-value, wide-column, document, and graph databases.

NoSQL stands for Not-only-SQL and looks at ways of storing data other than the traditional method that is relational databases.



		Advanatges of NoSQL over traditional method
		-------------------------------------------


* Big data - flexible schema

* Scalable

* Distributed -
	Fault tolerant

* High availability

	

			Properties of NoSQL
			------------------

* Elasticity : 
	- Add or remove resources as needed

* Sharding :
	- Automatic partitioning to distribute the load
	- Consistent Hashing

* Asynchronous Replication :
	- Store and forward approach

* Horizontal scaling :
	- Scaling out
	- Commodity hardware


BASE properties -
---------------

* Basically available
* Soft state -
	No mutual consistency gaurantees at a given time 
	NoSQL does not gaurantee consistency like RDBMS does after a transaction is complete
* Eventual consistency



			Types of NoSQL databases
			------------------------

* Key - Value
* Document
* Wide Column(e.g. Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Google BigTable)
* Graph
