We have the "Code" with which we "build" an "image".

An "image" is used to "create and run" a "container". 
The same images can be used to spawn up multiple Containers each with a name and ID.
Now each Container will have:
- Env Variables: whatever is used by the Code
- Volume: storage that needs to be allocated from local drives etc
    (Once the container is deleted the data is gone except when you mount volumes to and share the data)
- Ports
- Networks

The images can have multiple versions corresponding to the code version e.g. version 0, 1, 2, 3...
Thus "tag" denotes the "version" of the "image".
There is a special tag value called "latest" which corresponds to the latest version of the image

Where are the Images stored?
On a registry. The "images" can be "push/pull" from the "registry" 
(Just like code is pushed to registry, image is pushed to the registry like dockerhub)
