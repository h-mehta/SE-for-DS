We look to access an example MongoDB Database - the ProductOrder database. The ProductOrder database maintains an inventory of TV products of various brands and models. It allows users to place orders for one or more of these items, and offers discounts on these purchases.

In the ProductOrder database, there are mainly four categories of information:
● Productinformation 
● Inventoryinformation 
● Userinformation
● Orderinformation

Objective:
Having all this information in place we need to create a Database called ProductOrder and various collections in it. The collections needed and attributes which need to be in every collection are given by the Organization. All you have to do is create collections with data in it and write some queries so that the organization can retrieve required information.

Files Provided:
The resources that have been shared with you as part of the zipped JSON docs folder, there are 4 main files.
Product_info.json, Inventory_info.json, User_info.json, and Order_info.json The JSON files that contain the information to be inserted into the database.
