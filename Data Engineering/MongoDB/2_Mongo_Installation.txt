This document contains a walk through for installing MongoDB locally on Mac - Intel processor

1. Go to mongodb.com :

	https://www.mongodb.com


2. Since we want to install MongoDB locally : 

   Products -> Community Edition -> Community server

   ( Or directly go to : https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community )


3. Choose the platform and version & download.

   I selected the Mac OS 4.4.21 version as 4.x versions are tested and stable


4. Follow steps listed on MongoDB website:

   Install MongoDB Community on macOS using .tgz Tarball

   ( Refer : https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x-tarball/#install-mongodb-community-on-macos-using-.tgz-tarball )

   Basically : 
	* move binaries to /usr/local/bin/ folder, 
	* create data folder to which MongoDB will write the data,
	* create logs folder to which MongoDB will write the logs,
	* set permissions for the data and log directories.


5. Run MongoDB

   To run MongoDB, run the mongod process at the system prompt, providing the two parameters dbpath and logpath from above, 
   and the fork parameter to run mongod in the background.

   	command: mongod --dbpath /usr/local/var/mongodb --logpath /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log --fork


6. If the step 5 fails, this might be because of permission issues. 

	a. Navigate to the directory where the mongod executable file is located using the cd command. 

	   For example, if the mongod executable file is located in the /usr/local/bin directory, navigate to it by entering the following command:

		   cd /usr/local/bin

	b. Once you are in the directory containing the mongod executable file, run the following command to bypass the security check and open mongod:

       		   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine mongod

		   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine mongo

	   This will remove the quarantine attribute from the mongod executable file.

	
7. To check if mongodb is running:

	Open the terminal and type the command:
	
		mongo --version

	This should list the version of mongodb ( 4.4.21 )

	Aletrnatively, 

		ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod

	This will show you a list of processes that contain the word "mongod". 
	If MongoDB is running, you should see at least one process listed.
