MongoDB is a type of document DB.

A document database (also known as a document-oriented database or a document store) is a database that stores information in documents.
Instead of storing data in fixed rows and columns, document databases use flexible documents. 

( Refer: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/?_ga=2.208994842.908339707.1683613424-158453944.1683613423#flexible-schema )


			How is MongoDB different from other types of databases?
			------------------------------------------------------

In a relational database, relationships between data in different tables can be achieved through joins, and within hierarchical databases, 
relationships across nodes are impossible. MongoDB provides the ability to join documents through operations that match a variety of needs, 
such as $lookup, as well as through references.



				What is MongoDB
				---------------


* In MongoDB, rows (from RDBMS) are replaced by "document"
	    & tables (from RDBMS) are replaced by "collections"

* Data is stored in MongoDB in the form of BSON (binary form of JSON)

* By using a document-oriented approach, hierarchial relationships can be
 represented as single records.

* MongoDB is schema-free: a document's keys are not predefined or fixed in any way.


Equivalence in RDBMS and MongoDB:
--------------------------------

		RDBMS			MongoDB
		-----			-------
		Database	|       Database
		Table, View	|	Collection
		Row		|	Document ( JSON, BSON )
		Column		| 	Field
		Index		|	Index
		Join		|	Embedded Document
		Foreign Key	|	Reference
		Partition	|	Shard	
	

Example:

	{
		"Title" : "The cukoo",
		"Author" : "Robert",
		"Genre" : "Crime novel",
		"Detail" : {
			"Publisher" : "Little brown",
			"Language" : 2013,
			"Pages" : 500
			}
		"Price" : [
			{ 
			    "type" : "Hardcover",
			    "price" : 20
			},
			{   
			    "type" : "electronic",
			    "price" : 30
			}
			]
	}



Note that MongoDB is SCHEMA FREE
		     -----------

- There is no pre-defined data schema for Mongo DB
- It is possible for each document to have different data!


Example:

	{
		"name" : "Harshit",
		"eyes" : black,
		"hair" : blue
	},
	{
		"name" : "Utkarsh",
		"college" : "CMU"
	}
